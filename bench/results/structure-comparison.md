# Structured recovery comparison

These are exploratory results on the preserved study inputs, not held-out production accuracy.
Each adapter's denominators describe its attempted cohort. Failed calls remain in the denominators.
Unsupported retained Docling/Marker replays are listed separately and excluded from quality totals.
Positive grids, negative controls, and visual corpus spot checks are separate measurements.
Cell and relationship totals count the reference grid; spot checks do not cover a complete corpus page.
See STRUCTURE_BENCHMARKS.md for timing, source-agreement, training, and provenance limitations.
Truncated counts are lower bounds: older failed calls can lack generation metadata in the report.
